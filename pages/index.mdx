# What is it?

The main goal was to compare a
**Relay based GraphQL** with
a **Rest**
client.

Additionally, it contains a solution for
**mixing Relay and normal React**
components.

**Main navigation:**
You can use the links above for different views:

-   **GraphQL + Relay**

    -   fetches all information from a locally installed relay server.

        **Note:**

        _This needs a backend server / currently implemented as lambda function..._

-   **RESTFul Demo**

    -   just fetches info from Github&apos;s public open API via Rest calls.

-   **Storybook**
    shows all internal components.

-   **GitHub Repo**
    brings you to the source code.

# Examples

-   **lowsky/dashboard:** [**Rest**](./restful/lowsky/dashboard) or [**GraphQL Relay**](./relay/lowsky/dashboard) based, or [**side-by-side**](./side-by-side/lowsky/dashboard)
-   **lowsky/spotify-graphql-server:** [**Rest**](./restful/lowsky/spotify-graphql-server) or [**GraphQL Relay**](./relay/lowsky/spotify-graphql-server) based, or [**side-by-side**](./side-by-side/lowsky/spotify-graphql-server)

## How to start the local server

After installing the dependencies via `yarn install`,

you will also need to configure GitHub
authentication token in the `server/.env` file,

then simply run the local graphql server via and web app via `yarn run dev`

see [getting started in the README](https://github.com/lowsky/dashboard#getting-started)
