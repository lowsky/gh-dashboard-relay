# What is it?

**This website renders a GitHub repository's Feature Branches with their state and linking to each deployment.**

Btw. It is also a demo and playground to experiment with React Suspend possibilities: especially (using RFC 220): latest
React and React Server Components and Next.js App Router.

### Choose one of these different variants of data loading:

1.   [GraphQL + Relay](/relay)
    **GraphQL + Relay** - Using user's GH auth token!
    Fetches all information from the running relay server
2.   [Next based modern](/next)
    **Next.js app:** GH-Rate-limited, partially SSR, fails on authentication
3.   [Old way](/restful)
    GH-Rate-limited _for comparison only_ old-style!
    Fetching all data in a top-level `useEffect()` + props-drilling
