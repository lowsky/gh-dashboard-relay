import { LinkList } from 'components/LinkList';

## Classic way. Fetching all or nothing

Fetching all data in a top-level component via `useEffect()`. 

Manages the loading and error state in a via `useState`.

_(This is only for demoing. - Of course, there are libraries to support with this, like react-query, etc.)_


<LinkList rootPath="/restful" />
