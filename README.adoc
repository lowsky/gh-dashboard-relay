This project was used to figure out and to demonstrate, how to develop a frontend UI with Facebook's *Relay* and *GraphQL* libraries.

For deep interns of the concepts, see the link:https://lowsky.github.io/deck-graphql-relay-talk[presentation at the EnterJS Conference] with its link:https://www.github.com/lowsky/deck-graphql-relay-talk[slide sources]

== Purpose of this dashboard

This web app lists the (feature) branches of a specific github repository,

* shows the last commit's build status
* shows the last commit's commit message
* Later: links to running docker containers for each feature (not implemented yet)

On a meetup, I presented some details about the background idea: You can find the link:https://github.com/lowsky/dockerMeetupSlides[slides here]

== Getting started locally
A reduced functionality with a RESTful api backend works out of the box,
after invoking this in a shell:

```
git clone https://github.com/lowsky/dashboard
cd dashboard
npm install  # or  yarn
```

=== Start in dev-mode: this will do re-generating and re-loading
*The Relay part does not function in this mode, because the graphql-endpoint was not activated !*
```
npm run dev  # this opens the browser automatically
```
For local development this also uses webpack-dev based hot-reloading which
automatically updates the page in the browser!

== Start in normal mode, with built-in GraphQL-backend
```
npm start   # or   yarn run start
```
*Note:*
For Relay, you *need to create your own github-token* and store it locally:
```
# create your .env file as a copy of .env.example by
cp .env.example .env
# ... and adapt it with your API key:
# You can create one at
# https://github.com/settings/tokens/
```
It also provides a GraphIql IDE at http://localhost:8080/graphql - This is the ideal *playground*
for using and playing with different graphql queries.

Have fun!
